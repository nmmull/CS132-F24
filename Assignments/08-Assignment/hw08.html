The following assignment is due <b>Thursday 11/07 by 11:59 PM</b>.  You
should submit all your written solutions to Gradescope as a single
pdf.  Follow the instructions in the programming problem for code
solutions.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Your solutions must be <i>exceptionally neat</i> and the final answer in
your solution to each problem must be <i>abundantly clear</i>, e.g.,
surrounded in a very visible box.  The graders have license to dock
points for illegible or unclear solutions.</li>
<li>For the written part, choose the correct pages corresponding to each
problem in Gradescope.  Note that Gradescope registers your
submission as soon as you submit it, so you don't need to rush to
choose the pages. <b>You will receive no credit if you do not choose
the correct pages, no exceptions.</b></li>

(40 points) This week you will be building an interactive matplotlib
widget which can manipulate 2D renderings of 3D wireframes. Once
you're done, it should like something like this.
</p>


<div id="orgd7208d9" class="figure">
<p><img src="demo.png" alt="demo.png" width="800px" />
</p>
</div>


<p>
You are given starter code in the file <code>hw08.py</code>. <b><b>Don't change the
name of this file when you submit.</b></b> Also don't change the names of
any functions included in the starter code.  <b><b>The only changes you
should make are to fill in the provided TODO items.</b></b> You are also
given a separate file called <code>demo.py</code> which contains the code for the
matplotlib widget.
</p>

<p>
At a high-level the code works as follows:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>3D wireframes are represented of 3D line segments3D, which are
represented as pairs of 3D points, which are represented as triples
of floats. <code>shape_to_matrix</code> takes a 3D wireframe with \(n\) line
segments and converts it into a \(4 \times 2n\) matrix in which each
column is an endpoint of a line segment in the wireframe in
<i>homogeneous coordinates</i>.</li>

<li>This matrix of endpoints will be transformed by the matrix returned
by <code>transform_matrix</code>, which should implement a combination of
rotation and translation.  See the docstring for details.
<b>Important:</b> Note that translation should happen <i>after</i> rotation.</li>

<li>2D line segements are represented as pairs of 2D points, which are
represented as pairs of floats.  The function <code>matrix_to_shape</code>
should convert a \(4 \times 2n\) matrix into a list of \(n\) 2D line
segments that will be rendered on the screen.  This is done by
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>applying the projection matrix <b><b>with viewing position <code>(0, 0,
    10)</code></b></b> to the given matrix</li>
<li>then converting each column from homogeneous coordinates to 2D
Cartesian coordinates via the transformation discussed in lecture</li>
<li>then finally grouping every <b>two</b> points to create a list of line
segments.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>The above three functions are combined into a single function called
<code>full_transform</code>. This function should:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>convert the 3D shape to a matrix</li>
<li>apply the transformation matrix</li>
<li>convert the matrix to a 2D rendering</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Once you've completed every TODO item, you should be able to run
<code>python3 demo.py</code> to see the widget in action.
</p>

<p>
<b>Extra credit (5 points)</b> For a small amount of extra credit, you can
 build a wireframe (of some reasonable complexity) in
 <code>extra_credit_shape</code> which can be viewed in the widget.  In order to
 get this credit, you must include <b>in the written part of your
 submission</b> an image of your rendered wireframe, translated and
 rotated a bit (like in the example image above).  In particular, you
 have to first complete the required parts of the assignment.  You
 must also give your shape a name in <code>extra_credit_name</code> (no credit if
 you picture says "my shape").  Also please state along with your
 image if you are comfortable making the image public (in case I
 collect the results on a public facing website).
</p>

<p>
You will upload a single file <code>hw08.py</code> to Gradescope, where you can
verify that it passes some (but not all) autograder tests.  <b><b>Please
test your system early.</b></b> There may be system dependent issues that
we'd like to address as early as possible.
