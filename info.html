<b>CAS CS 132 (Geometric Algorithms)</b> is an introduction to <b>linear
algebra</b> with a bent towards applications in computer science. One of
its primary goals is to prepare students (you) for courses in the CS
curriculum at BU which require some degree of linear algebra. Due to
the fundamentality of linear algebra, in machine learning, in graph
algorithms, in optimization, in graphics (and so on), this list of courses
is substantial.
</p>

<p>
I want to also make clear at the offset that this is <i>not</i> a course in
computational geometry in the traditional sense; we will not cover
some beautiful topics like triangulation, mesh generation, geometric
data structures, or convex programming (despite the seemingly
out-dated description of the course in our registrar).
</p>

<p>
Instead, we will be covering other beautiful topics like matrix
factorization, eigenvectors, Markov chains (and so on again). The
"geometric" part comes from the way we will learn to <i>think</i>
geometrically, in how linear algebra will help us conceptualize data
as something spatial. Professor Mark Crovella has a nice note on this
in the <a href="http://mcrovella.github.io/CS132-Geometric-Algorithms/landing-page.html">preface of the text</a> we will be using for this course.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>

<p>
⟪ <i><b>Material</b></i> ⟫ We will primarily be using the <a href="http://mcrovella.github.io/CS132-Geometric-Algorithms/landing-page.html">online text</a> written by
Professor Mark Crovella for this course. The text is a jupyter
notebook which you can <a href="https://github.com/mcrovella/CS132-Geometric-Algorithms">access online</a>. All supplementary material will
be made available on this site and on Piazza.
</p>

<p>
Much of the material in this online text is based on the textbook
<b>Linear Algebra and its Applications</b> by David Lay, Steven Lay and
Judi McDonald.  I recommend taking a look at this book if you need
extra practice, particularly because of the number of exercises in
it. I will also refer to <a href="https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/index.html">Interactive Linear Algebra</a>, a beautiful
textbook out of Georgia Tech by Dan Margalit and Joseph Rabinoff.
</p>

<p>
⟪ <i><b>Programming</b></i> ⟫ The programming assignments for this course (and
the examples in the text) are written in <b>Python</b> with the libraries,
NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, NetworkX and matplotlib. It is required that you
set this up on you personal machine or on a machine that you will have
access to over the semester. Please attend office hours and use Piazza
if you need help troubleshooting. If you are worried about access to
technology, please contact me <i>as soon as possible</i> and we can see
what we can do (though I cannot make any guarantees).
</p>

<p>
⟪ <i><b>Course Communication</b></i> ⟫ Course announcements and discussions will
happen on <b>Piazza</b>. If you are unfamiliar with Piazza, see their
<a href="https://support.piazza.com/support/solutions/48000185443">support page</a> for information and tutorials. Some policies regarding
the use of Piazza:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Don't ask homework questions directly.</b> Formulate a question which
will aid in your understanding, and will hopefully help others as
well.</li>
<li><b>Don't give homework solutions directly.</b> The answer-provider is
just as culpable as the answer-receiver in cases of cheating.</li>
<li>Piazza is as useful as it is active. Teaching fellows and course
assistants will be answering questions on Piazza, but don't hesitate
to answer questions yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p>
⟪ <i><b>Homework Submission</b></i> ⟫ Assignments are submitted on <b>Gradescope</b>. If
you are unfamiliar with Gradescope, see their <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/get_started">get-started page</a> for
information and tutorials.
</p>

<p>
⟪ <i><b>Office Hours</b></i> ⟫ Please see Piazza for posted offices hours.

<h2 id="orgca5a6d1">Evaluation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgca5a6d1">
<p>
⟪ <i><b>Homework</b></i> ⟫ Problem sets are <b>assigned each Thursday</b> and are
<b>due the following Thursday by 11:59PM</b>. You can discuss assignments
during sections on Mondays, but TF/TAs will not go into details of the
problems.
</p>

<p>
Each assignment will consist of two parts, one part <i>analytical</i>
(calculations) and one part <i>computational</i> (code).
</p>

<p>
For the analytic portion, you will <b>submit a PDF via Gradescope</b>. Your
submissions may be scans of handwritten notes or PDFs created using
Word, markdown, LaTeX, etc. (this is the preferred choice, and I
highly recommend learning LaTeX, especially if you're interested in
doing research). Handwritten submissions MUST be neat and the
graders have license to dock points if your submission is not legible.
For the computational portion, you will <b>submit code via Gradescope</b>.
</p>

<p>
There are <b>12 problem sets</b> in total (the last one is shorter but
worth the same amount) and your <b>10 highest scores</b> will contribute to
your final grade.
</p>

<p>
<b>Late assignments will not be accepted.</b> This allows us to post
solutions in a timely manner.
</p>

<p>
Expect to commit some time each week to these assignments.
</p>

<p>
⟪ <i><b>Exams</b></i> ⟫ There will be <b>one midterm</b> and a <b>cumulative final</b>.
</p>

<p>
⟪ <i><b>Participation</b></i> ⟫ Part of your grade will be determined by your
participation in a weekly Google form.
</p>

<p>
⟪ <i><b>Grading</b></i> ⟫ Your final grade will be determined by
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>50%</b> homework (top 10 of 12 scores)</li>
<li><b>20%</b> midterm exam</li>
<li><b>25%</b> final exam</li>
<li><b>05%</b> participation</li>
</ul>

<p>
Cut-offs for letter grades will be determined at the end of the
course. I cannot guarantee what the cut-off will be, but you will not
receive a letter grade lower than the one determined by your <a href="https://www.bu.edu/academics/wheelock/policies/grades-course-credits-incomplete-coursework/">raw
percentage</a>.
